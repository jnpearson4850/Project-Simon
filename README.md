##**Simon-Memory Game Project 1**

##**Description**

This project is a simple Simon says game. Where the computer generates a random assortment
of colors. It is then your turn to copy what the computer iterated. You continue to advance until 
you get one round wrong. At that point the computer logs your high score. 

This project solves the age-old problem of forgetting where you left your keys....By making you exercise that 
memory muscle. Science!!!


##**Brief Example**

Unfortunately I do not have an example. I was only able to complete the HTML/CSS and add function to the "Start and "Try again" button. 

##**List of Features**

This game has a sweet background and a cool formation for the rings. 

##**List of Technologies used**

HTML/CSS/Javascript

##**Getting Started**

Very simple. You click the "Start Game" button. After that you do what Simon Says. In theory it would have 
tracked how many levels you completed and gave you a high score. 

##**Contribution Guidelines**

The project visuals are good to go. I need help creating the event clicks that track what the user did and compares it to the computer generated colors.
